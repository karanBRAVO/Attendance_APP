# Attendance_APP
- In this I have created Attendance app for teachers.
# Why ???
- Since everything is done through phone, laptops, PC's and other electronic devices so now I have come up with a idea to take the attendace through mobile or laptop.
# Just have a look on the Attendance app:
- photo will be updated soon...
# Steps involved
- I started up with hypertext markup language(HTML) and cascading styles sheet(CSS) and javascript(JS) for frontend part
- and for the backend I will use node js and mongodb and express js.
# But how it will take attendance? 
- I think question you are asking and if not then ask it
- Now I am going to reveal it's answer :)
- Basically we have `two web pages` one of which is owned by the `head` and other one will be for `student`
- For Teacher's part they will start the attendance session and then students login with their login id through their web page
- then teacher will generate a `code` and add `numbers of students` are in class
- only those students will be able to give their attendace who will get the code
- all this will be stored in DB
- if there are more of less numbers of students who logged ind through code(as code might get shared to other students who are absent) then attendance will not be added to Database
- session will expire in given time
# How to count the number of student
- Here I will use some external devices to calculate the number of student
- The device will capture the number of student and autofill the form
