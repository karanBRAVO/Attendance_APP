# Attendance_APP
- In this I have created Attendance app for teachers.
- Since everything is done through phone, laptops, PC's and other electronic devices so now I have come up with a idea to take the attendace through mobile or laptop.
- Just have a look on the Attendance app:
-
- I started up with hypertext markup language(HTML) and cascading styles sheet(CSS) to javascript(JS) for frontend part
- and for the backend I will use node js.
- But how it will take attendance? I think question you are asking and if not then ask it
- Now I am going to reveal it's answer :)
- Basically we have two web pages one of which is owned by the head and other one will be for student
- For Teacher's part they will start the attendance session and then students login with their login id to their web page
- then teacher will generate a code which will expires after a given time
- only those students will be able to give their attendace who will get the code
- all this will be stored in DB
- But what if code is shared?
- for that everyone should be attentive during the attendance session and session duration will be short
